This project focuses on analyzing Netflix's collection of movies and TV shows up until 2019. The main goal is to group these shows into meaningful categories using advanced techniques to improve user experience through a recommendation system. This system will help Netflix keep its subscribers engaged and prevent them from canceling their subscriptions.

Additionally, the project aims to cover important insights and trends in the world of streaming entertainment by looking at the dataset.

Here's how the project was done step by step:

1. **Exploring Data:** The data was closely examined to find patterns that could help prevent users from leaving.

2. **Creating Clusters:** Shows were grouped based on different features like director, cast, and genre. This helps in organizing content better.

3. **Grouping Algorithms:** Different algorithms were used to create clusters. This ensures that similar shows are grouped together.

4. **Recommendation System:** A system was built to suggest shows based on user preferences. This way, users get recommendations that match their interests, making them more likely to stay subscribed.

By completing this project, i aim to make Netflix more enjoyable for users. Grouping shows and offering tailored recommendations should make users happier and encourage them to keep using Netflix.
